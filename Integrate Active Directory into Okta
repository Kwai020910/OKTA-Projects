# Integrating Active Directory into Okta

This guide provides a step-by-step process for integrating Active Directory (AD) with Okta, enabling seamless identity and access management across your organization.

## Prerequisites
- An Okta account with administrative privileges.
- Access to your Active Directory environment.
- Okta AD Agent installed on a server within your AD domain.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install the Okta AD Agent
1. **Download the Okta AD Agent**:
   - Log in to your Okta Admin Console.
   - Navigate to **Directory** > **Directory Integrations**.
   - Click **Add Directory** and select **Active Directory**.
   - Download the Okta AD Agent installer.

2. **Install the Agent**:
   - Run the installer on a server within your AD domain.
   - Follow the installation wizard instructions.
   - Enter your Okta organization URL and administrator credentials when prompted.

### Step 2: Configure the AD Agent
1. **Agent Configuration**:
   - After installation, the Okta AD Agent Configuration Wizard will launch.
   - Select the AD domains you want to integrate with Okta.
   - Provide the credentials for an AD account with sufficient privileges to read user and group information.

2. **Agent Settings**:
   - Configure the agent settings, such as the polling interval and user profile attributes to sync.
   - Click **Finish** to complete the configuration.

### Step 3: Set Up Directory Integration in Okta
1. **Add Directory**:
   - In the Okta Admin Console, navigate to **Directory** > **Directory Integrations**.
   - Click **Add Directory** and select **Active Directory**.
   - Follow the prompts to add your AD domain.

2. **Configure Import Settings**:
   - Set up import settings to define how users and groups are imported from AD to Okta.
   - Choose whether to import users automatically or manually.

3. **Map Attributes**:
   - Map AD attributes to Okta user profile attributes.
   - Ensure that required attributes such as username, email, and first/last name are correctly mapped.

### Step 4: Test the Integration
1. **Import Users and Groups**:
   - Perform an initial import to bring users and groups from AD into Okta.
   - Verify that the import is successful and that user profiles are correctly populated.

2. **Test Authentication**:
   - Test user authentication by logging in with an AD user account.
   - Ensure that the user can access Okta and any assigned applications.

### Step 5: Configure Provisioning (Optional)
1. **Enable Provisioning**:
   - In the Okta Admin Console, navigate to **Directory** > **Directory Integrations**.
   - Select your AD integration and go to the **Provisioning** tab.
   - Enable provisioning features such as user creation, updates, and deactivation.

2. **Configure Provisioning Settings**:
   - Define the provisioning actions and mappings for user lifecycle events.
   - Save your settings and test the provisioning functionality.

### Troubleshooting
- **Agent Connectivity**: Ensure the Okta AD Agent can communicate with both Okta and your AD domain.
- **Attribute Mapping**: Verify that attribute mappings are correct and that required attributes are populated.
- **Import Errors**: Check the import logs for any errors and resolve issues related to user data or permissions.

### Conclusion
Integrating Active Directory with Okta streamlines identity management and enhances security across your organization. By following this guide, you can ensure a smooth and successful integration process.
